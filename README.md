# Project-HashMap

This project is a custom implementation of a HashMap data structure in JavaScript. It supports storing key-value pairs with efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion, while handling collisions using linked lists. The hash map also automatically resizes when the load factor is exceeded to maintain performance.
